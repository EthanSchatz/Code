To run, first run DominoesServer.java and then DominoesClient.java for them to connect properly. This is the first game I've made using Java sockets to make a local network connection between client and server. It was a school project.

Click+Drag to move piece that is yours. (Server = bottom dominoes, Client = top dominoes)
Right Click to turn domino 90 degrees.
It is assumed that both players know the rules and know to take turns.
