A simple paint pad I made when I got bored and we were learning some cool stuff in class and I put it to use. 
I even tinkered with it to change the color every time you click/drag so that it looks as if the colors are in a line.
It looks as if the colored dots are being added at the tail of the line instead of the front. 

Just click and drag.
